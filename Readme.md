# Enhanced Task Manager

I have done this application in Spring, in order to use Spring Data to connect and work with database.<n>
As for database, I am using mySql deployed in a Docker container.</n>
I have implemented Gradle as Automated Build Tool.</n>
I have added a little bit more functionality based on the initial exercise. Now command <i>-createUser</i> has an optional parameter <i>-gId</i> which specifies groupId.
And using command <i>-addTaskToGroup</i> it is possible to add a task to multiple users who are in that group.</n>
Unfortunately, I have never worked with tests before, so I didn't manage to fulfill the last requirement.</n>
